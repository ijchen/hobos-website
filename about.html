	<p class="normalText">
		We are Hobos, a competitive e-sports organization primarily focused on
		Overwatch. We have been growing the team and participating in
		competitive games since early season 29, and now have over half a dozen
		members.
	</p>
	<p class="normalText">
		We focus on learning and improving with a growth mindset. We encourage
		our members to enjoy the game, and work actively seek to work together
		effectively.
	</p>
	<p class="normalText">
		Hobos is currently run by Bue, who founded the clan and has been
		managing it ever since.
	</p>
	<p class="normalText">
		Our team communicates primarily in a private Discord server. We
		regularly practice in quick-play games to warm up, then hop into
		competitive matches after a few practice games. We don't play on a
		regular schedule, since the team member's individual schedules would be
		too difficult to permanently coordinate.
